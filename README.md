# Project-Ideas
A list of ideas that can be made into wonderful projects (hopefully)

- Porting Inventory Tweaks for Minecraft 1.16+: https://github.com/Inventory-Tweaks/inventory-tweaks
- Interactive Jupyter Notebook but with a remote server to judge all in-class small coding practices. Should also but capable for monitoring student's coding process live.
- TA marking scheme creator/helper
- BrainStack: push your current thinking context to the stack, switch to a different task, finish that task, and return and resume with the same thinking context. Also trace your sequential thinking process.
